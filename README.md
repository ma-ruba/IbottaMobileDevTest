# IbottaMobileDevTest - iOS

This project showcases my skills as an iOS Engineer and was developed as part of the application process for the Ibotta company. The project focuses on demonstrating my proficiency in Clean Architecture, utilizing the MVVM design pattern, and showcasing my ability to work with complex data structures and UI components.

# Project Overview
- Architecture: Clean Architecture
- Design Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Backend: Utilized a provided JSON file for data simulation

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide an illustrative snapshot of my capabilities as an iOS Engineer. While the code may not be production-ready, it offers insight into how I structure code, manage dependencies, and create maintainable, scalable, and modular applications.

# Project Timeline
The project was developed within a tight schedule of 5 days, showcasing my ability to efficiently manage time and deliver results within a constrained timeframe.
